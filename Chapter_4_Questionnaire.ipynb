    "The first part of the pixel similarity approach is to create the \"average three\" and the \"average seven\". Each pixel value of these averages corresponds to the mean of all the values of this particular pixel from all threes (or all sevens respectively). This is what we compare against in the classifier. \n",

    "\n",
    "After establishing the distance of the picture at hand from the averages, the classifier picks the value that is the smallest, that is if the distance of the test picture is smaller from the \"average three\" than it is from the \"average seven\" then the classifier selects 3 as its guess."

For example a tensor that has a shape 3,7,4 is essentially a 3 dimensional matrix with 4 entries available in the first dimension, 7 entries for the second and 3 for the 3rd. The three numbers that are returned via the tensor.shape attribute correspond to the rank of the tensor."
